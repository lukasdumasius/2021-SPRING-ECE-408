2. List Op Times (CPU convolution implemented) for batch size of 1k images

Convolution Op Time 1: Op Time: 8297.14 ms
Convolution Op Time 2: Op Time: 24041.9 ms

3. List whole program execution time (CPU convolution implemented) for batch size of 1k images

Total program execution time: real    1m23.748s

4. Show percentage of total execution time of your program spent in your forward pass function with gprof

As you can see above in the ouput, the program spent 83.39% of the time in the conv_forward_cpu function.
